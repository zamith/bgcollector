        <p class="mb-6">Do you remember the feeling of getting a new board game?</p>

        <p class="mb-6">I'm guessing you do, if you're like me, getting a new game is something you do quite often. There's multiple ways a game can get to you, from buying at a store (in person or online), to buying at eBay, a Math Trade, conference Bring and Buy, or even some random person off of the Geek Market or a Facebook group.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">There is an inherent confidence we put on stores to deliver the product in a perfect state, it's their business and the game is brand new, after all. This is where the system fails for almost all the other options listed above, it puts tremendous pressure on the buyer to trust the seller. In a perfect the world this wouldn't be an issue and you wouldn't hear stories of rip offs, but this is not a perfect world, and you do.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>I've tried all of the options mentioned above and found them all lacking and stressful.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">I really do feel, we can create a better option for all the wonderful gamers out there that are looking to get a game, as well as  the ones that want to rotate one out of their collection.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">Current technology allows us to create an online marketplace built around a community that does not have to trust each other in order to exist. Despite how contradictory that might sound, it is my belief that this will ultimately lead to tighter and happier community, as we take the worries away.</p>
